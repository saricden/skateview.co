title: About Skateview
---
<p>
  Skateview is a blog for exploring skateboard parks in 360 all over the world. I love skateboarding, was amazed by 360 spherical panoramas from the moment I first saw one, and love to write code. So this is my combination of all those things.
</p>
<p>
  Above all else Skateview is a place for travelling skaters to find and explore parks around the world.
